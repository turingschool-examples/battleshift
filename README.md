# BattleShift

This project was a brownfield project where we were given a codebase that included a lot of dead and useless code intermixed into still useful classes and methods.  Our job, given a spec harness was to add functionality and begin refactoring the parts of the code necessary to make the spec harness pass within the time allocated by the project deadline.

### Versions/Prerequisites
---
##### Main:
To Install and run this application please be aware of the following versions and requirements:
- PostgreSQL 10+
- Rails 5+
- Ruby 2.4+

###### Secondary:
- ActiveRecord
- ActiveModelSerializers
- PG
- Puma

### Setup
---
- First clone down this repository and change directory into the project directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/nergdnvlt/battleshift.git
cd battleshift
```
- Then in your command line run bundle to install the gem dependencies:
```
bundle
```
- Now setup your database and run the migrations to properly set up your database tables:
```
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
```
- It's now time to seed the database with the supplied Etsy-like data:
```
rake build:users
```
- At this point the project is set up. From here you have several options.

- This will give you access to two users. You will have to store their email and api_key attributes to run the spec harness.

- In the command line, enter rails console
```
rails c
```
And find the two users:
```
User.all
```
Take the api_keys for each user and substitute them in for the <API-KEY> values here:
```
export BATTLESHIFT_API_KEY=<API-KEY>
export BATTLESHIFT_EMAIL=test1@test.com
export BATTLESHIFT_OPPONENT_API_KEY=<API-KEY>
export BATTLESHIFT_OPPONENT_EMAIL=test2@test.com
```
Keep these values close by, you will need them to run the spec harness.

###### Gems

- DatabaseCleaner
- FactoryBot
- Rspec
- ShouldaMatchers

###### Approaches

- Doubles
- Factories

#### Test Documentation and Tweaks

- For additional documentation and the individual tests as the suite runs:
```
--format=documentation
```
- Additional Useful Flags:
```
--order=random
--color
```

##### About The Tests:
 The test suite includes test for the following:
- Model Level Testing<br>
These tests can be found in the following folder:
```

```
- Request Testing<br>
These tests can be found in the following folders:
```
spec/requests/api/v1/games
```
These test test the following categories of endpoints: Model, Relationship, and Business Intelligence.

##### Running The Suite:
- In order to run the test suite, from the root project folder simply run:

rspec
```

### Running the Spec Harness
---

#### Spin up a Server:
- First in the root project folder, spin up your server:
```
rails s
```
<br>

#### Clone down the Spec Harness:

- First open another tab in your command line tool.

- Git clone the spec harness into a folder at the same level as the root of the BattleShift project folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/turingschool-examples/battleshift_spec_harness
```
```
- Main Project Folder
  |_ battleshift
      |_app
      |_bin
      |_config
      |_...
  |_ battleshift_spec_harness
      |_spec
      |_...
```

- Change directory into the battleshift_spec_harness folder

```
cd battleshift_spec_harness
```

#### Export the environment variables:

- In the command line tab copy and paste the export variables.
```
export BATTLESHIFT_API_KEY=<API-KEY>
export BATTLESHIFT_EMAIL=test1@test.com
export BATTLESHIFT_OPPONENT_API_KEY=<API-KEY>
export BATTLESHIFT_OPPONENT_EMAIL=test2@test.com
```

#### Running the harness:

- With the server still running in the tab at the root of the project folder, in the other tab (where you're at the root of the spec harness) run:
```
rspec
```

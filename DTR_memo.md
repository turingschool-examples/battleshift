## DTR Memo for Battleshift
Project: Battleshift

Group Member Names: Adam Lusk, Evan Wheeler

Goals and expectations:
* Practice refactoring other people's dirty code
  * Make the code base more reusable by end of project
  * Build out 1 player vs computer functionality
* Be comfortable with Action mailers
* Solidify understanding of API calls and API auth

Team strengths:
* Thorough at testing, and stubborn about full test coverage
* Strong communication skills
* Decent refactoring strategy

How to overcome obstacles:
* After about an hour, check in with team-mate on card progress
* Rely heavily on Waffle, make small cards that track single tasks
* One or two lines of code per commit
* Use Bugs waffle board for the 'fixing the light bulb' issues

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
* Evenings and into late night on Slack
* During project work time at school

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
* We are both available on Slack, and will message about what we are working on and pull requests
* Waffle for task management, and Pull Requests for code commenting and review

Areas for desired improvement:
* Generating user specific API keys and securing api using the keys
* Using decorators, serializers, and other means of encapsulation to handle non-standard web functions

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
* TBD as the project evolves

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
* Use Waffle to define tasks in progress, communicate about assigning new tasks and opening pull requests
* Create branch for small tasks, make multiple commits, many PR's per day. Everything in small chunks

Tools:
* Mailcatcher for action mailer
* Factorybot for stubbed objects and mocks
